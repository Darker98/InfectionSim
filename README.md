# ü¶† Infection Spread Heatmap Simulation

This project simulates the spread of an infectious disease using a proximity-based SIR model and visualizes it as a heatmap. Instead of tracking individual people or graph connections, the simulation focuses on infection **density** over time from a **top-down aerial view**, similar to how outbreaks are mapped in real-world epidemiology.

## üåç Concept

- Uniformly distributed agents across a 2D map.
- Slight Brownian motion to simulate interaction.
- Proximity-based infection: agents infect others within 5 meters.
- Infection probability decreases exponentially with distance.
- Agents recover after a random time.
- Recovered agents can be reinfected, but with lower probability.
- Heatmap shows infection **density**, not people.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Brownian motion (minimal movement)
- ‚úÖ SIR model: Susceptible ‚Üí Infected ‚Üí Recovered
- ‚úÖ Reinfection support
- ‚úÖ Per-pixel infection heatmap (OpenGL GPU-accelerated)
- ‚úÖ Custom-sized pixel grid (e.g., 200√ó150) rendered full-screen
- ‚úÖ Real-time rendering using PyOpenGL + GLFW
- ‚úÖ Scalable and optimized with spatial hashing
- ‚úÖ Configurable menu for parameters (planned)

## üñ•Ô∏è Screenshot

You can include a screenshot like this (place image in the same directory):

```
![Simulation Screenshot](screenshot.png)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the image file (e.g., `screenshot.png`) exists in the same folder as this README.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Planned Menu Options

A configuration menu (or JSON config file) is being planned to allow easy customization of:
- Screen resolution
- Heatmap grid resolution
- Recovery time range
- Infection radius
- Reinfection rate
- Number of agents

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- [`numpy`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [`PyOpenGL`](https://pypi.org/project/PyOpenGL/)
- [`PyGLFW`](https://pypi.org/project/glfw/)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy PyOpenGL PyGLFW
```

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

```bash
python main_heatmap.py
```

The window will show a red heatmap, where:
- Light red = low infection density
- Bright red = high infection density

No individual agents are shown ‚Äî only the infection spread as a visual.
